# Mina Attestations

This is a TypeScript library that implements _private attestations_: A cryptographic protocol that allows you to selectively disclose facts about yourself.

**Try our demo: [mina-attestations-demo.zksecurity.xyz](https://mina-attestations-demo.zksecurity.xyz)**

The library is available on npm and designed for all modern JS runtimes.

```
npm i mina-attestations
```

## What are private attestations?

The attestation flow usually involves three parties:

1. an _issuer_ that makes a statement about you and hands you a certificate of that statement: a _credential_.

- Example: Your passport is a credential issued by a government agency. It contains valuable information about you.

2. a _verifier_ that is interested in some particular fact about you (that is contained in a credential).

- Example: To sign up users, a crypto exchange must check that they are not US citizens. The exchange acts as a verifier.

3. you, the _user_, who controls your own credentials. You can decide to create privacy-preserving _presentations_ of a credential, disclosing just the information that a verifier needs to know.

- Example: Prompted by the crypto exchange's request, you create a presentation about your passport, proving that it comes from a non-US country.
- The crypto exchange never learns any other information contained in your passport, and can still trust your presentation.

<!-- TODO: add diagram -->

Mina Attestations helps you implement all parts of the flow described above. It unifies the required interfaces and data types.

Under the hood, private attestations rely on [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).
Mina Attestations builds on top of [o1js](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js), a general-purpose zk framework for TypeScript.

## Attestation DSL

One of the main contributions is an easy-to-use DSL to specify the attestations a verifier wants to make about a user.
Continuing from the example before, the crypto exchange might specify their conditions on the user's passport as follows:

```ts
import { PresentationSpec, Claim, Operation } from 'mina-attestations';
import { UInt64 } from 'o1js';
import { PassportCredential } from './credential-specs.ts';

let spec = PresentationSpec(
  { passport: PassportCredential.spec, createdAt: Claim(UInt64) },
  ({ passport, createdAt }) => ({
    assert: [
      // not from the United States
      Operation.not(
        Operation.equals(
          Operation.property(passport, 'nationality'),
          Operation.constant(String.from('United States'))
        )
      ),
      // passport is not expired
      Operation.lessThanEq(
        createdAt,
        Operation.property(passport, 'expiresAt')
      ),
    ],
  })
);
```

> Note: This example is simplified, see [our code example](https://github.com/zksecurity/mina-attestations/blob/main/examples/mock-zk-passport.eg.ts) for more details.

The Attestation DSL is, essentially, a radically simplified language for specifying custom zk circuits, tailored to the use case of making statements about user data. It has several advantages over a general-purpose circuit framework like o1js:

- Simple enough to be readable by a user (in pretty-printed form), who wants to understand what private information is shared
- Fully serializable into space-efficient JSON. No concerns about malicious code execution when used to produce zk proofs from a trusted environment, like a wallet
- Easier to write and harder to mess up for developers

## Bonus: `mina-attestations/dynamic`

Under the sub-import `mina-attestations/dynamic`, we export an entire library of dynamic data types and hashes with o1js.

Features:

- `DynamicSHA2` for hashing dynamic-length inputs with SHA2-256, -224, -384 or -512
- `DynamicString` and `DynamicBytes` for representing strings and bytes
- `DynamicArray`, a generalization of the above types to an arbitrary element type
- `StaticArray`, which provides an API consistent with `DynamicArray` but for _fixed-length_ arrays (which aren't well-supported in o1js either)
- `DynamicRecord`, a wrapper for objects that you don't necessarily know the exact layout of, but can be hashed and accessed properties of inside a circuit
- `hashDynamic()`, for Poseidon-hashing pretty much any input (including plain strings, records, o1js types etc) in a way which is compatible to in-circuit hashing of padded data types like `DynamicRecord` and `DynamicArray`

The sub-library is intended to help with importing **real-world credentials** into the Mina ecosystem: For example, to "import" your passport, you have to verify the passport authority's signature on your passport data. The signature relies one of several hashing and signature schemes such as ECDSA, RSA and SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512. Also, the signature will be over a dynamic-length string.

Example of SHA-512-hashing a dynamic-length string:

```ts
import { Bytes, ZkProgram } from 'o1js';
import { DynamicSHA2, DynamicString } from 'mina-attestations/dynamic';

// allow strings up to length 100 as input
const String = DynamicString({ maxLength: 100 });

let sha512Program = ZkProgram({
  name: 'sha512',
  publicOutput: Bytes(64); // 64 bytes == 512 bits

  methods: {
    run: {
      privateInputs: [String],
      async method(string: DynamicString) {
        let publicOutput = DynamicSHA2.hash(512, string);
        return { publicOutput };
      },
    },
  },
});

await sha512Program.compile();

let result = await sha512Program.run(String.from('Hello, world!'));
let provenHash: Bytes = result.proof.publicOutput;

console.log(provenHash.toHex());
```
